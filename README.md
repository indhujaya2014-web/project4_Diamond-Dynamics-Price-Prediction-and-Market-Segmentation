# 💎 Diamond Dynamics: Price Prediction and Market Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
The diamond market relies heavily on quality attributes such as carat, cut, color, and clarity to determine pricing. This project builds a **machine learning system** to:

1. Predict diamond prices using multiple regression models and ANN
2. Segment diamonds into meaningful market groups using clustering
3. Deploy the solution using a **Streamlit web application**
